# Future-Ready-Talent-Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

This is the project that I've created for Microsoft Future Ready Talent Virtual Internship Program

Project Title : Social Media Sentiment analysis

Problem Statement/Opportunity:

Today ,the textual data on the internet is growing at a rapid pace. Different industries are trying to use this huge textual data for extracting the peopleâ€™s views towards their products. Social media is a vital source of information in this case. It is impossible to manually analyze the large amount of data. This is where the need of automatic analyzation using technology becomes apparent.

Project Description:

I've developed this project for Future Ready Talent Internship. In this particular project we analyze the tweets for a specific hashtag using integration with the logic app. Here, we even use Azure Cognitive Services for text analysis. Azure Logic Apps is an excellent tool for analyzing data for social platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. It allows automating design workflows using triggers, connectors.

Primary Azure Technology: AI + Machine Learning, Azure Cognitive Service, Logic Apps, Text Analytics
